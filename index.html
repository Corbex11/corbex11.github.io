			<h2>Crystal FM: A radio-like music provider for Discord.</h2>
			<img src="media/cfm.png" class="shadow" style="float: left">
			<p>Crystal FM was a radio-like music provider built for <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord, an online messaging & voice service.</a>. Rather than serving on-demand song requests (as many other Discord-based music services did), Crystal FM simply provided easy access to a steady stream of cherry-picked songs.</p>
			<p>The songs Crystal FM played primarily consisted of pop music released between the 1960s and 1990s, which was complemented with a wide range of unique instrumental tracks. They could've been songs I'd heard in movies, on the radio, or anywhere else where music happened to be playing. </p>
			<p>I ran Crystal FM 24/7 for about a year, after which it was no longer practical to keep the bot running. The bot was primarily used within a group online friends when we would regularly listen to music together.</p>
