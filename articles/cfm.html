						<h1>Crystal FM: A radio-like music provider for Discord.</h1>

						<center><h2>1. Introduction</h2></center>
						<img src="media/cfm.png" class="shadow" style="float: left;" alt="Crystal FM logo">
						<p>
							Crystal FM was a radio-like music provider built for <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord, an online messaging & voice service</a>.
							Rather than serving on-demand song requests (as many other Discord-based music services did), Crystal FM simply provided easy access to a steady stream of cherry-picked songs.
						</p>
						<p>
							The songs Crystal FM played primarily consisted of pop music released between the 1960s and 1990s, which was complemented with a wide range of unique instrumental tracks.
							They could've been songs I'd heard in movies, on the radio, or anywhere else where music happened to be playing.
						</p>
						<p>
							Crystal FM was online for about a year, after which it became impractical to keep the service running.
							The bot was primarily used within a group of online friends when we would regularly listen to music together.

						<center><h2>2. History</h2></center>
						<p>
							Originally, Crystal FM existed under a different name: <b>Wave24R</b>, which stood for "Wave24 Radio" - the "24" referencing the 24/7 music playback on offer.
						</p>
						<p>
							The initial version of the bot was accompanied by a separate service titled <b>Pre70sR</b>, short for Pre-1970s Radio.
							As the name suggests, this version of the bot was dedicated to any tracks released before the 1970s. It played many of the older tracks I had in my collection.
							By separating the two services, Wave24 Radio could continue without mixing too many distinct eras, which would have resulted in an inconsistent listening experience.

						<center><h2>3. Developing Crystal FM</h2></center>
						<img src="media/w24rr2.png" style="float: right;" alt="'Wave24R (rewrite #2)'">
						<p>There are three iterations of the code powering Crystal FM:
							<ol>
								<b><li>Wave24R Discord Bot</li></b>
								<p>
									This version of Wave24R is a modular Discord bot built to represent different "brands" of music bot (such as Crystal FM).
								</p>
								<b><li>Wave24R Icecast Server</li></b>
								<p>
									This version of Wave24R was intended for use as an internet radio station. It created an audio livestream to broadcast the music to any client.
									This worked in parallel with a simple Discord bot I built to listen to the stream (amongst others) in any Discord voice channel.<br>
									To use it, you simply connected to a voice channel and sent a chat command specifying which station you wanted to listen to.
								</p>
								<b><li>Crystal FM based on "S.A.F.E."</li></b>This was the final rewrite of Crystal FM
							</ol>

						<center><h3>Technical Details</h3></center>
						<p>
							Crystal FM was written in <a href="js.html">JavaScript</a>. More specifically, the server-side runtime environment <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a>.<br>
							I hosted Crystal FM on a Dell OptiPlex 760 desktop computer for about a year, after which it was no longer practical to keep running.
