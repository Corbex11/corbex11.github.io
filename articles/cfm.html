						<h2>Crystal FM: A radio-like music bot for Discord.</h2>
						<h3>Introduction</h3>

					<p>
						<b>Crystal FM</b> was a bot built for playing music in voice channels on <a href="https://discord.com">Discord</a>.
						Unlike most Discord music bots at the time, Crystal FM was not intended for on-demand song requests.
						Instead, it was supposed to provide easy access to a steady stream of specific songs.
					</p>
					<p>
						The songs Crystal FM played mostly consisting of 80s, 70s and 60s pop music, intertwined with a wide range of instrumental tracks.
						They could've been songs I'd heard from the radio, films, e.t.c.
					</p>
					<p>
						I ran Crystal FM 24/7 for about a year, after which it was no longer practical to keep the bot running.
						The bot was primarily used in a server of online friends where we would regularly listen to music together.

					<center><h3>History</h3></center>
					<p>
						Before all of this, however, Crystal FM existed under a different name as <b>Wave24R</b>.
						This was short for Wave24 Radio, with the "24" referencing the 24/7 music playback in a dedicated voice channel.
						This version of the bot was only hosted in my personal Discord server, and was accompanied by a separate bot titled <b>Pre70sR</b>, short for Pre-1970s Radio.
						As the name suggests, this version of the bot was dedicated to all things pre-1970s, and played any older tracks I added to the collection.
						This meant that Wave24 could continue without mixing multiple distinct eras, creating a more consistent listening experience.
					</p>

					<p>There are three iterations of the code powering Crystal FM:
						<ol>
							<b><li>Wave24R Discord Bot</li></b>
							<p>
								This version of Wave24R is a modular Discord bot built to represent different "brands" of music bot (such as Crystal FM).
							</p>
							<b><li>Wave24R Icecast Server</li></b>
							<p>
								This version of Wave24R was intended for use as an internet radio station. It created an audio livestream to broadcast the music to any client.
								This worked in parallel with a simple Discord bot I built to listen to the stream (amongst others) in any Discord voice channel.<br>
								To use it, you simply joined a voice channel and sent a command specifying which station you wanted to listen to.
							</p>
							<b><li>Crystal FM based on "S.A.F.E."</li></b>This was the final rewrite of Crystal FM
