					<p><b>Crystal FM</b> was a bot built for playing music in voice channels on <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a>. Unlike most Discord music bots at the time, Crystal FM was not intended for on-demand song requests. Instead, it was supposed to provide easy access to a steady stream of specific songs.</p>
					<p>The songs Crystal FM played mostly consisting of 80s, 70s and 60s pop music, intertwined with a wide range of instrumental tracks. They could've been songs I'd heard from the radio, films, e.t.c.</p>
					<p>I hosted Crystal FM continuously at home using a Dell OptiPlex 760 for about year, after which it was no longer practical to keep running. The bot was primarily used in a server of online friends where we would regularly listen to music together.</p>
					<p>Before all of this, however, Crystal FM existed under a different name as <b>Wave24R</b>. This was short for Wave24 Radio, with the "24" referencing the 24/7 music playback in a dedicated voice channel. This version of the bot was only hosted in my personal Discord server, and was accompanied by a separate bot titled <b>Pre70sR</b>, short for Pre-1970s Radio. As the name suggests, this version of the bot was dedicated to all things pre-1970s, and played any older tracks I added to the collection. This meant that Wave24 could continue without mixing multiple distinct eras, creating a more consistent listening experience.</p>
					<p>There are four iterations of the code powering Crystal FM:
