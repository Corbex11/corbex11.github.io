					<h1>Song Review: Rupert Holmes</h1>
					<p>I like music, so much so that I've decided to write down a few of my thoughts on some of my favourite tracks.<br>
						Music is a platform upon which people can express their ideas and tell their stories. It’s a reason to keep pushing through the most mundane of chores.<br>
						It can be a joyful reminder of the past or a forgetful, eager glance into the future.<br>It can take us into somebody else’s past, and it can lead us to fantasize about what could be.
						<br><br>Music can have many meanings to different people, so I’ve decided to share my interpretations of some of my favourite tracks and what they mean to me.
						To singer-songwriter Rupert Holmes, music is a great way to share immersive and comedic stories. If you’re familiar with “The Pina Colada Song” – “Escape” by Rupert Holmes – then you’ve already been exposed to Holmes’ work in the music industry.
						Rupert Holmes was born in England as David Goldstein in 1947 and later went on to change his name and begin writing plays, novels, TV shows and music.
						Throughout the mid-seventies and up until the nineties, Holmes produced eight albums, all of which he had composed and performed almost entirely by himself, with backing-singers only occasionally introduced in some of the tracks.
						In 1979 Holmes released his single titled “Escape”.</p>
