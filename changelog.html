			<!-- Formatting rules for new entries to the changelog:
				1. Start with the date on which changes were made.
				2. Prefix = for general changes (such as replacing an image, without removing the space in which it is shown).
				3. Prefix + for additions (such as new features or pages).
				4. Prefix - for removals (such as removal of unused images, sounds, or pages).
				5. Optionally, place any relevant images wherever deemed appropriate in the entry.

			<h1>Website Changelog</h1>
			<p>
				Looking back on the progress of a project can be very satisfying. So, I'm creating this changelog to look back on in the future.<br>
				You can also see the <a href="oldchangelog.html">old changelog</a> for a list previous changes. But, it may be more confusing due to the lack of context behind some entries.<br>
				<br>
				The following is a list of changes I've made to the site, starting from the 3rd of February 2022.
