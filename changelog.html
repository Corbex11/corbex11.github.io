		1. Start with the date on which changes were made.
		2. Prefix = for general changes (such as replacing an image, without removing the space in which it is shown).
		3. Prefix + for additions (such as new features or pages).
		4. Prefix - for removals (such as removal of unused images, sounds, or pages).
		5. Optionally, place any relevant images wherever deemed appropriate in the entry.

				<h1>Website Changelog</h1>
				<section>
					<p>
						Looking back on the progress of a project can be very satisfying. So, I'm creating this changelog to look back on in the future.<br>
						You can also see the <a href="oldchangelog.html">old changelog</a> for a list previous changes. But, it may be more confusing due to the lack of context behind some entries.
