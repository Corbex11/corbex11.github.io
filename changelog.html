			1. Start with the date on which changes were made.
			2. Prefix = for general changes (such as replacing an image, without removing the space in which it is shown).
			3. Prefix + for additions (such as new features or pages).
			4. Prefix - for removals (such as removal of unused images, sounds, or pages).
			5. Optionally, place any relevant images wherever deemed appropriate in the entry.

						<p>
							Looking back on the progress of a project can be very satisfying. So, I'm creating this changelog to look back on in the future.<br>
							You can also see the <a href="oldchangelog.html">old changelog</a> for a list previous changes. But, it may be more confusing due to the lack of context behind some entries.
