				<h2>Crystal FM: A radio-like music bot for Discord.</h2>
				<img src="media/cfm.png" class="shadow" style="float: left">
				<p>Crystal FM was a bot built for playing music in voice channels on <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a>. Unlike most Discord music bots at the time, Crystal FM was not intended for on-demand song requests. Instead, it was supposed to provide easy access to a steady stream of specific songs.</p>
				<p>The songs Crystal FM played mostly consisting of 80s, 70s and 60s pop music, intertwined with a wide range of instrumental tracks. They could've been songs I'd heard from the radio, films, e.t.c.</p>
				<p>I ran Crystal FM 24/7 for about a year, after which it was no longer practical to keep the bot running. The bot was primarily used in a server of online friends where we would regularly listen to music together.</p>
